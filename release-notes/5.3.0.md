The one big change is that Across development has moved to an
[internal GitLab server](https://gitlab.isaac.nl/antwerpen/across/),
with the repositories also mirrored to
[GitHub](https://github.com/ForeachOS).

The Across modules have been reorganized into a much smaller number of
git repositories, to ease the release process. As a result of this,
there are a few small changes you need in your application.

# Git repositories

new GitLab repository location + GitHub sync

Note that in the merged repositories, the history of all files has
been preserved, because all modules were merged using
`--allow-unrelated-histories`.


# Compatibility notes

## Liquibase upgrade

TODO


## Image Server

The Maven `groupId` for the ImageServer modules has been changed from
`com.foreach.imageserver` to `com.foreach.across.modules`:

- A simple search&replace for those `groupId`s through your `pom.xml`
  should be sufficient to quickly and safely migrate. The Maven
  `artifactId`s are still the same.

- The Java package names have not been modified, and are still start
  with `com.foreach.imageserver`, so there's nothing to change in your
  code.

## Removed modules

The following modules have been removed from `across-platform`:

- `spring-batch-module` (latest release: `2.2.1.RELEASE`): Only used
  in some legacy microservices (PDF generator, which will be replaced
  with an entirely different implementation).

- `spring-mobile-module` (latest release: `3.2.1.RELEASE`) : Spring
  Mobile itself is end-of-life:
  https://spring.io/projects/spring-mobile

- `oauth2-module` (latest release: `3.2.1.RELEASE`): A concurrency
  integration test started failing in combination with H2 (not the
  other databases), when upgrading to Maven 3.9: most likely the root
  cause is the more recent build of Java 8 of the Maven 3.9 docker
  image. Given the legacy state and limited use of this module, it is
  not worth the effort of attempting to fix this.

The previous releases of those modules will most likely continue to
work with this version of `across-platform`. You will have to manually
configure the version of those modules, most likely in your top-level
parent `pom.xml` file.
