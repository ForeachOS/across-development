been preserved, because all modules were merged using

# Compatibility notes

The Maven `groupId` for the ImageServer modules has been changed to
`com.foreach.across.modules`

The following modules have been removed from `across-platform`:

- `spring-batch-module` (latest release: `2.2.1.RELEASE`): Only used
  in some legacy microservices (PDF generator, which will be replaced
  with an entirely different implementation).

- `spring-mobile-module` (latest release: `3.2.1.RELEASE`) : Spring
  Mobile itself is end-of-life:
  https://spring.io/projects/spring-mobile

- `oauth2-module` (latest release: `3.2.1.RELEASE`): A concurrency
  integration test started failing in combination with H2 (not the
  other databases), when upgrading to Maven 3.9: most likely the root
  cause is the more recent build of Java 8 of the Maven 3.9 docker
  image. Given the legacy state and limited use of this module, it is
  not worth the effort of attempting to fix this.

The previous releases of those modules will most likely continue to
work with this version of `across-platform`. You will have to manually
configure the version of those modules, most likely in your top-level
parent `pom.xml` file.
